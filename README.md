COMP272 Programming Assignment 8

This assignment has several parts.

The first part, you are to implement the findRoot method in the Graph class. This method should determine the "root" of the graph, defined as the vertex with no incoming edges. The method should return the ‘value’ of the root vertex. If there is no such unique vertex, or more than one root vertex is found, then return -1.

The second part is a problem solution required for a method that will ensure that any student pursuing the certificate of 'master programmer', can complete 'n' certification exams, each being specific to a topic. In this case, some exams of these exams may have prerequisites of needing to take and pass earlier certificate exams. You do not want to force a student in taking specific orders the exams, but you want to make sure that at least one order that can be possible and taken.

The third part is a problem solution required to be implemented for a method that that will return the number of groups of connected friends. In this case, you are given 'n' people. Some of them are connected as friends forming groups. Not all these groups of friends are interconnected, meaning that there are 1 or more groups non-interconnected groups of friends. The problem is to determine teh number of groups.
